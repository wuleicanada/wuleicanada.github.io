<p align="left">LOS ANGELES, Jan.  13, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Based on his viewpoint that the historic contributions of the Hip-Hop generation has largely been ignored by popular culture, actor and Comedian Doug E. Doug has released his first novel titled, “The Fall of 1987,” which tells dramatic story of a young Black man investigating the mysterious death of his brother during the rise of the Hip-Hop genre.<br /></p>  <p>“I noticed that there was little attention paid to my generation in media,” said Doug. “Mythmakers and storytellers go on and on about the World War II generation - the so-called "Greatest generation. The achievements of the Civil Rights generation are chronicled with due heroism and some complexity. Now, we are launching into the voices and perspectives of the Millennials and Gen Y.”</p>  <p>Doug wants to lead an effort to preserve the experiences of the Hip-Hop generation and their impact on the world.</p>  <p>“This book is a step toward dealing with complexity of life in the Post-Civil Rights era amidst the highly destructive crack epidemic and the dawn of mass incarceration,” Doug said. “Our voices are desperately needed right now during this highly charged political climate where we can have a greater and decisive social impact.”</p>  <p>“The Fall of 1987” centers on 19-year-old Joe Thomas Jr. who decides to piece together the stories told to him about the last days of his brother's life to solve his murder. While trying to solve the "case,” Joe examines the forces and events that shaped his life and caused the break-up of his family.
